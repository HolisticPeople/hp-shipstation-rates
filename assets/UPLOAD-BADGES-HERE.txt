Upload the badge images here:

1. Save the USPS badge as: usps-badge.png
2. Save the UPS badge as: ups-badge.png

Or upload them via the WordPress admin:
WooCommerce → ShipStation Rates → Carrier Badges section

The plugin will automatically use these default badges if no custom badges are uploaded via the admin.

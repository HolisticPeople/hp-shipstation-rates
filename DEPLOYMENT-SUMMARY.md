## 🎓 Key Technical Achievements

### 1. Smart Caching Architecture
**Problem:** WooCommerce recalculates shipping on every checkout update  
**Solution:** Intelligent caching based on what actually affects rates

```php
// Only these trigger recalculation:
- ZIP code change
- Country change
- Product add/remove
- Quantity change

// These use cache (instant):
- Method selection
- Street/city/state changes
- Payment method changes
- Any other checkout update
```

### 2. Dynamic Service Discovery
**Problem:** International service codes unknown/hardcoded  
**Solution:** Query ShipStation with multiple test destinations

```php
Test Destinations:
- US (90210) - Gets domestic services
- Israel (2015500) - Gets international services  
- UK (SW1A 1AA) - Gets additional international services

Result: Complete service list (8-12 services discovered automatically)
```

### 3. Minimal Hash Generation
**Problem:** Full package serialization created unstable hashes  
**Solution:** Extract only essential data

```php
// Cart hash: Only IDs + quantities
['id' => 123, 'qty' => 2]

// Destination hash: Only ZIP + country
['zip' => '90210', 'country' => 'US']

// Result: Stable hashes, better cache hits
```

### 4. Rate Storage
**Problem:** Returning early from `calculate_shipping` left WooCommerce without rates  
**Solution:** Store actual rate arrays in cache

```php
// Store complete rate arrays:
set_transient($cache_key, $all_rates, 120);

// Retrieve and add directly to WooCommerce:
foreach ($cached_rates as $rate) {
    $this->add_rate($rate);
}
```

## 🧪 Testing Summary

### Functional Testing
- ✅ Service discovery works (3 test destinations)
- ✅ Rates display on checkout
- ✅ Custom names work
- ✅ Price sorting works
- ✅ Cache works (method selection instant)
- ✅ ZIP changes trigger recalculation
- ✅ International addresses work
- ✅ Text fields fully editable
- ✅ Visual feedback works
- ✅ Debug logging clean

### Performance Testing
- ✅ Initial load: 3-4s (ShipStation API - expected)

## 🔍 Known Issues & Limitations

### External Performance Factors
**Issue:** Checkout still feels slow even with our caching  
**Cause:** Other plugins (EAO, Fluent Support, Admin Columns) initializing on frontend  
**Evidence:** Debug logs show no `calculate_shipping` calls, but plugins initializing repeatedly  
**Resolution:** Not our plugin - external issue. Consider caching plugins for overall site performance.

**Our plugin performance:** ✅ EXCELLENT (cache working perfectly)

## 🎯 Production Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [x] All features tested on staging
- [x] Debug code removed
- [x] Production version number set (2.1.0)
- [x] Documentation complete
- [x] Git committed
- [x] Release notes written

### Deployment Steps
1. [ ] Set up GitHub remote (optional - currently local-only)
2. [ ] Disable old OneTeam plugin on production
3. [ ] Deploy via GitHub Actions (push to main) OR manual upload
4. [ ] Activate plugin on production
5. [ ] Configure API credentials
6. [ ] Fetch services
7. [ ] Enable desired services
8. [ ] Add to shipping zones
9. [ ] Test checkout on production
10. [ ] Verify no ghost orders in ShipStation
11. [ ] Monitor debug logs for 24 hours

### Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Rates appearing correctly
- [ ] Custom names displaying
- [ ] Cache working (check logs)
- [ ] No ghost orders
- [ ] Performance acceptable
- [ ] No PHP errors

## 📞 Support & Maintenance

### Debug Logging
Enable in plugin settings to see:
- Cache hits/misses
- API call timing
- Rate count
- Service codes
- Errors

Log location: `wp-content/debug.log`

### Cache Management
**Clear plugin caches:**
```bash
wp transient delete --all
```

**Or:**
Deactivate and reactivate plugin

### Troubleshooting
1. Enable debug logging
2. Check debug.log
3. Look for `[HP SS]` entries
4. Common issues:
   - No rates: Check credentials, enabled services
   - Slow: Check if `calculate_shipping` being called (should use cache)
   - Wrong rates: Clear cache, verify ZIP code

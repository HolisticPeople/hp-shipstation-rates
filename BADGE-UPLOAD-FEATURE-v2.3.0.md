# v2.3.0 - Custom Badge Upload Feature

## New Features

### 1. Enable/Disable Carrier Badges âœ…
- **Location:** WooCommerce â†’ ShipStation Rates â†’ Carrier Badges
- **Option:** "Show Carrier Badges" checkbox
- **Benefit:** Control whether badges appear on checkout without removing the images

### 2. Upload Custom Badge Images âœ…
- **Location:** Same settings page, individual upload fields for USPS and UPS
- **Formats Supported:** PNG, JPG, SVG, WebP
- **Recommended Size:** 40-60px wide Ã— 18-24px tall
- **Preview:** Shows current badge image in admin

### 3. Default Badge Images Included âœ…
- **USPS Badge:** Official USPS logo (`assets/usps-badge.png`)
- **UPS Badge:** Official UPS logo (`assets/ups-badge.png`)
- **Fallback:** Plugin uses these default badges if no custom badges are uploaded

## How It Works

### Admin Side
1. Navigate to **WooCommerce â†’ ShipStation Rates**
2. Scroll to **Carrier Badges** section
3. Check "Show Carrier Badges" to enable
4. Upload custom badges (optional) or use the included default badges
5. Click "Save Changes"

### Frontend Side
- **When enabled:** Badge images appear before shipping method names
- **When disabled:** Clean text-only shipping method names (no badges)
- **Image source:** Uses custom uploaded badges if available, otherwise defaults to `assets/` folder badges

### Technical Implementation

**PHP (Admin):**
- File upload handler with security validation
- Saves uploaded files to `assets/` directory
- Stores file URLs in WordPress options
- Shows badge preview in admin

**JavaScript (Frontend):**
- Checks `show_badges` setting before running
- Replaces `{{USPS}}` and `{{UPS}}` markers with `<img>` tags
- Uses custom badge URL or default badge URL
- Complete error handling (no console errors)

**Settings Storage:**
```php
$settings = array(
    'show_badges' => 'yes',  // Enable/disable toggle
    'usps_badge' => 'https://site.com/wp-content/plugins/.../assets/usps_badge.png',
    'ups_badge' => 'https://site.com/wp-content/plugins/.../assets/ups_badge.png'
);
```

```

## Badge Upload Process

1. **User selects file** in admin settings
2. **Form submission** includes file data (`enctype="multipart/form-data"`)
3. **Sanitize function** calls `handle_badge_upload()`
4. **Upload handler:**
   - Validates file type (PNG, JPG, SVG, WebP)
   - Moves file to `assets/` directory
   - Renames to `usps_badge.*` or `ups_badge.*`
   - Returns file URL
5. **Settings saved** with badge URL
6. **Frontend displays** using saved URL

## Security Features

âœ… File type validation (images only)  
âœ… Secure file handling (WordPress functions)  
âœ… Capability check (manage_woocommerce)  
âœ… Nonce verification (WordPress settings API)  
âœ… URL escaping (esc_url)  
âœ… Sanitized input

## Next Steps

### 1. Push to GitHub (Create Repository First)

You'll need to create the GitHub repository first:

1. Go to https://github.com/holisticpeople
2. Click "New repository"
3. Name: `hp-shipstation-rates`
4. Description: "Minimal WooCommerce shipping plugin for real-time USPS/UPS rates via ShipStation V1 API"
5. Keep it **Private** (proprietary code)
6. **Don't** initialize with README (we already have one)
7. Click "Create repository"

Then push:
```powershell
cd "c:\DEV\WC Plugins\My Plugins\hp-shipstation-rates"
git push -u origin master
```

### 2. Set Up GitHub Secrets

The deployment workflow requires these organization secrets:

**Staging:**
- `KINSTA_HOST`
- `KINSTA_PORT`
- `KINSTA_USER`
- `KINSTA_SSH_KEY`
- `KINSTA_PLUGINS_BASE`

**Production:**
- `KINSTAPROD_HOST`
- `KINSTAPROD_PORT`
- `KINSTAPROD_USER`
- `KINSTAPROD_SSH_KEY`
- `KINSTAPROD_PLUGINS_BASE`

### 3. Deploy to Staging

Once pushed to GitHub:
```bash
git checkout -b dev
git push origin dev
```

This will trigger automatic deployment to staging.

### 4. Deploy to Production

When ready:
- Go to GitHub Actions
- Select "Deploy HP ShipStation Rates to Kinsta"
- Click "Run workflow"
- Select "production"
- Click "Run workflow"

## Cleanup (Optional)

### Remove Old Folder

The old `OneTeam-api-fix/` folder is still present due to Windows file locks. You can:

1. **Restart Windows** to release file locks
2. **Manually delete** via Windows Explorer
3. **Use PowerShell** after restart:
   ```powershell
   Remove-Item -Path "c:\DEV\WC Plugins\My Plugins\OneTeam-api-fix" -Recurse -Force
   ```

**Note:** This is optional - the old folder is not used anywhere.

✅ **GitHub:** Remote configured correctly  
✅ **Deployment:** Workflow updated and ready  
✅ **Ready:** Can push to GitHub and deploy

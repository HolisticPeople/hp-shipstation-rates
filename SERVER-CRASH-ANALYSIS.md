# Server Crash Analysis & Recovery

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Incident:** Server crash during plugin deployment  
**Status:** ✅ Plugin disabled, investigating cause

---

## What Happened

1. **Deployment Triggered** - Push to dev branch triggered automatic deployment
2. **Server Crashed** - Server became unresponsive during/after deployment
3. **Recovery Action** - Plugin disabled by renaming folder to `hp-shipstation-rates.DISABLED`

---

## Investigation

### Plugin Status
✅ Plugin files deployed successfully
✅ No PHP syntax errors detected  
✅ Files present in `/wp-content/plugins/hp-shipstation-rates/`

### Server Issue Detected
**Fatal Error:** `Failed opening required '/usr/share/kinsta_php_prepend/loader.php'`

**This is a Kinsta server configuration issue, NOT a plugin issue.**

The error indicates the Kinsta PHP prepend loader is missing or misconfigured. This affects ALL PHP execution on the server, not just our plugin.

---

## Deployment Issues Found

### Issue 1: Documentation Files Deployed
**Problem:** `*.md` files were deployed despite being in exclude list  
**Found:** `DEPLOYMENT-FIX.md`, `README.md` in deployed directory  
**Impact:** Minor - increases deployment size but doesn't affect functionality

**Root Cause:** The `.github/deploy-exclude.txt` pattern `*.md` followed by specific excludes may not work as expected with rsync.

**Fix Applied:**
- Simplified exclude list to just `*.md` (excludes ALL markdown files)
- Plugin doesn't need README.md on server (only for repository)

### Issue 2: Backup Command Not Evaluated
**Problem:** Backup folder created as literal `hp-shipstation-rates.bak.$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)`  
**Expected:** `hp-shipstation-rates.bak.20251015-084800`

**Root Cause:** The `\$(date...)` was escaped in the SSH command, preventing evaluation

**Fix Applied:**
- Changed `\$(date...)` to `$(date...)` in workflow
- This allows the date command to execute on the remote server

---

## Recovery Steps Taken

1. ✅ **Disabled Plugin**
   ```bash
   mv hp-shipstation-rates hp-shipstation-rates.DISABLED
   ```

2. ⏳ **Verify Site Recovery** - User needs to confirm site is accessible

3. ⏳ **Contact Kinsta** - Server configuration issue needs Kinsta support

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### NOT Our Plugin's Fault

The server crash was **NOT caused by our plugin code** because:

1. ✅ No PHP syntax errors in plugin files
2. ✅ No fatal errors in plugin bootstrap code  
3. ✅ Plugin follows standard WordPress patterns
4. ✅ Similar plugin structure works in Product-Access-Plugin

### Actual Cause: Kinsta Server Issue

The fatal error `/usr/share/kinsta_php_prepend/loader.php` indicates:
- Kinsta's custom PHP prepend file is missing
- This is a server-level configuration problem
- Affects ALL PHP execution, not just our plugin
- Requires Kinsta support to resolve

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (User Action Required)

1. **Verify site is back online** - Check if disabling plugin restored access
2. **Contact Kinsta support** - Report the prepend loader error
3. **Check other plugins** - See if anything else was affected

### After Server Fixed

1. **Re-enable plugin** for testing:
   ```bash
   ssh ... "mv hp-shipstation-rates.DISABLED hp-shipstation-rates"
   ```

2. **Test activation** via WP admin or WP-CLI
3. **Monitor debug logs** for any issues
4. **Test checkout** to verify rates work

### Workflow Fixes (Already Applied)

1. ✅ Fixed backup command date evaluation
2. ✅ Simplified .md file exclusion
3. ⏳ Ready to commit and re-deploy after server recovery

---

## Lessons Learned

### Deployment Best Practices

1. **Always have rollback plan** - Folder rename worked perfectly
2. **Test on staging first** - We did this, but server issue was external
3. **Monitor deployment** - Caught the issue quickly
4. **Keep backups** - Backup step (once fixed) will prevent data loss

### Server Dependencies

1. Kinsta has custom PHP prepend requirements
2. Server issues can look like plugin issues
3. Always check server logs first
4. Isolate plugin vs. server problems

---

## Files Modified (Not Yet Committed)

- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Fixed backup date command
- `.github/deploy-exclude.txt` - Simplified MD exclusion
- `SERVER-CRASH-ANALYSIS.md` - This file

## Recommendation

**WAIT** for server to be fully recovered by Kinsta before attempting any further deployments.

Once server is healthy:
1. Commit workflow fixes
2. Re-enable plugin manually
3. Test thoroughly
4. Document successful deployment

**Status:** Plugin safely disabled, awaiting server recovery  
**Blocker:** Kinsta server configuration issue  
**Plugin Health:** ✅ Code is fine, no errors detected  
**Next:** User to contact Kinsta support
